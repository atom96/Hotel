In this application we have different types of clients (perfectionist, conciliatory etc.)
who can make reservation for a room. They can describe what kind of room they want (price,
date of reservation, price, color of walls etc.). There are also different types of receptionists,
who read forms filled by clients and propose a room. They also have different strategies
(they may look for perfect room, the most expensive, random etc.). Client may accept proposition or not.
It depends on clients stategy.
